The following notebooks describe an agent-based model (ABM) used to demonstrate the emergence of task partitioning in the foraging behavior of leaf-cutting ants with regards to two phenomenological behavioral traits and leaf dropping length. The files build the system by:

- [setting up the model using an object-oriented Mesa framework, detailing how to run/display the simulation and how to iterate model runs for data collection/visualization](https://nbviewer.org/github/pgovoni21/ants-task-partitioning-ABM/blob/main/ABM.ipynb)
- [using the iterated data to plot heatmap landscapes, showing the relationship between ant output as well as behavior in relation to different trait combinations](https://nbviewer.org/github/pgovoni21/ants-task-partitioning-ABM/blob/main/landscapes.ipynb)
- [approximating ant behavior from a deterministic approach, using differential equations to describe ant movement and decision-making](https://nbviewer.org/github/pgovoni21/ants-task-partitioning-ABM/blob/main/deterministic-approx.ipynb)
